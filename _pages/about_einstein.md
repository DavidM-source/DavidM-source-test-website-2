Hello, My name is David Moore. I am a third-year PhD student in the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department at UCLA. With the support of Dr. Jonathan Mitchell, my current research focuses on understanding the dynamical and thermodynamical processes that dictate tropical cyclone favorability outside of Earth-like environments. To achieve this, I use a combination of general circulation models (GCM's) and cloud-resolving models (CRM's) to mimic the desired environment.
